Thinks To Remember...

-> Id Must be unique.

-> jQuery stops Traversing the DOM once its hit the ID of the Element you are looking for.

Ex: if you select Id in jQuery with $('#'+event.target.id) you'll get the ID and jQuery starts Traversing in DOM, and if 
    you have multiple ID's with same name jQuery only selects the first id and return it.
    
    With multiple ID's and if you want to Perform some task in that particular Element which clicked, then in alternate way you can select that
    particular Element by event.target and perform some opreation on it, we can play with that Element because we are selecting
    only that Element in which event is occur,Above we are selecting the ID in which event occur that's we have to face that type
    of problem.
